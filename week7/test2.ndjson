It snaps on easily and comes off better than some of my other cases. I like how the top \u0026 bottom is completely open so my charger \u0026 headphones fit perfectly .  The only down side is that it dose not provide any protection other than from scratches so if you drop your phone a lot than I wouldn't recommend this case but if you don't than I think it's a great value.","overall":4.0,"summary":"Very cute","unixReviewTime":1325289600,"reviewTime":"12 31, 2011","category":"Cell_Phones_and_Accessories","class":1.0}
